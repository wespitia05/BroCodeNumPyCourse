# numpy stands for numerical python
# its a python library used for numerical computing
# wildly used in fields like data science, engineering, AI/ML
# under the hood, numpy is written in c

# EXAMPLE
# np.array([1, 2, 3]) * 2 = [2, 4, 6] - uses numpy
# [1, 2, 3] * 2 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] - uses regular python
